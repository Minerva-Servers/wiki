Throughout Minerva's story, several groups shape the world's fate:

- **The Resistance**: Scattered survivors uniting into a global front.  
- **Remnants of the Combine**: Once dominant, now fractured, retreating into strongholds.  
- **Regional Coalitions**: New unions and commonwealths rising to fill the power vacuum.  
- **Civilian Populations**: Ordinary people caught between collapse and liberation.
