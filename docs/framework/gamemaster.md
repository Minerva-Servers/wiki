# Gamemaster System

The Gamemaster System provides the tools needed to run narrative-driven events.  
It allows staff to:
- Trigger cinematic scenes.  
- Spawn entities, NPCs, and objectives.  
- Track progression through chapters.  
- Manage checkpoints and event states.

This system ensures that chapters flow smoothly and that events can adapt to player choices in real time.
