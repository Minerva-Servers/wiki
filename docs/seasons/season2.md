# Season Two (2023 – 2025)

Season Two tried a very different approach.  
It quietly began as **Black Mesa RP**, but drifted back to HL2 RP with versions 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, and 0.7 (0.7.1–0.7.6).  

During development:
- Work on **version 0.8** led to a full schema rewrite, delaying progress for months.  
- By **version 0.9**, the team was laying the foundation for 1.0.  
- **Version 1.0** had multiple identities:  
  - First: a Half-Life 2 retail aesthetic server using *Entropy Zero* lore layered in.  
  - Second: a more direct HL2 retail approach with a pre-built workshop map.  
  - Final: a **fully retail experience**, using official Valve VMFs to craft a custom City 17 with unique layouts and map changes.

Season Two was long, turbulent, and experimental—pushing Minerva through rewrites and restarts, but laying groundwork for its current form.
