# Season One (October 2022 â€“ January 2023)

Season One was the start of **Minerva**.  
It originally launched as an SCP RP server, but quickly refined itself into **Half-Life 2 RP** through version releases 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3.

Highlights:
- The community embraced the early HL2 RP focus.  
- It became Minerva's **biggest success** in terms of hype and activity.  
- It also became the **biggest downfall**, burning bright but ending fast.

Season One lasted only a few months, but left a strong mark on players and established Minerva's identity.
