# Season Three (2025 â€“ Present)

Season Three is the **current active season**.  
It abandons constant rewrites and experiments in favor of a clear structure: **story Chapters** managed with a custom framework.

This season features:
- **Chapters** telling a cohesive narrative (Shadow of Borealis, Echoes in the Loop, Uprising in City Eight).  
- A full **Parallax framework** with a Gamemaster system.  
- Refined visuals, lore consistency, and cinematic roleplay.  
- The strongest emphasis yet on structured events and community-driven play.
