# Seasons Overview

The **Seasons of Minerva** track the out-of-character history of the project itself.  
Each season reflects not only different roleplay settings and frameworks, but also the evolution of the community and its experiments.

* **Season One (2022–2023)**: The chaotic but beloved launch, from SCP RP origins to HL2 RP success and collapse.  
* **Season Two (2023–2025)**: Experiments, rewrites, and constant iteration, from Black Mesa RP roots to the ambitious but turbulent HL2 retail focus.  
* **Season Three (2025–)**: The current focus, refined into structured **Chapters**, telling the story of humanity's uprising.
